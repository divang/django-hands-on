Download get-pip.py
https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py

Run the above py file which install the pip:
python get-pip.py

Install virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper: virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper provide a dedicated environment 
for each Django project you create. While not mandatory, this is considered a best practice and 
will save you time in the future when you’re ready to deploy your project. 
Simply type:

pip install virtualenvwrapper-win

Then create a virtual environment for your project:
mkvirtualenv myproject

If you start a new command prompt, you’ll need to activate the environment again using:
workon myproject

Install Django:
pip install django

verify your Django installation by executing 
python -m django --version

Creating a project
django-admin startproject mysite

Folder structure:
mysite/
    manage.py
    mysite/
        __init__.py
        settings.py
        urls.py
        wsgi.py

python manage.py runserver

Django version 2.2, using settings 'mysite.settings'
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Quit the server with CONTROL-C.

To create your app, make sure you’re in the same directory as manage.py and type this command:
python manage.py startapp polls

create a directory polls, which is laid out like this:
polls/
    __init__.py
    admin.py
    apps.py
    migrations/
        __init__.py
    models.py
    tests.py
    views.py
    
Write your first view. Open the file 
polls/views.py

from django.http import HttpResponse
def index(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, world. You're at the polls index.")
    
To create a URLconf in the polls directory, create a file called urls.py
from django.urls import path
from . import views
urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.index, name='index'),
]
